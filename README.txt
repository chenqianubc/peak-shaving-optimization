# This is a multi-objective transient peak shaving optimization model of a gas pipeline system under demand uncertainty.

# The tra.xlsx file contains the initial conditions and boundary conditions of the optimization model.

# The stopt.jl file is the stochastic optimization model.

# The rbopt.jl file is the robust optimization model.
